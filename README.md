## FairVGNN
This repository is an official PyTorch(Geometric) implementation of FairVGNN in "Fair View Graph Neural Network for Fair Node Representation Learning". The whole flowchart of our model is visualized in the sequal.

## Requirements
This repository is built using PyTorch and PyTorch-Geometric. You can install the necessary libraries by pip installing the requirements text file.
```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt 
```

## Run
* To reproduce the performance comparison and the ablation study, please first unzip each dataset in the dataset folder and run
```linux
bash run.sh
```
